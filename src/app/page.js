                  Cafe Pista is a local caf√© here in Montreal. I rebuilt their shopify webstore using a modified version of
                  an existing Shopify theme. I was the sole developer on this project, but I worked closely with a designer.
                  There were several custom components involved including slideshows, multiple
                  styles of collection pages, and timeline. The webstore integrates with several Shopify apps for specific
                  functions, such as language translation, subscription services and wholesale services. Some of the challenges
                  of this project revolved around integrating these apps, other challenges were in responsive styling, and conditional
                  styling, dependant on collection and product.

                  This is stage one in the development of Dish, an app designed to integrate with existing dating apps and help
                  ensure safety in the online dating scene. Stage one is primarily designed to collect questionnaire responses from users.
                  With this goal I designed a gamification system to encourage users to fill out reports and to invite their friends.
                  Under this system users can earn badges, points, and compete against other schools to showcase the school&apos;s
                  safety score. Challenges of this project revolved mainly around the questionnaire, and ensuring the results were
                  accessible and usable. Future goals for this project involve allowing users to get reports on their upcoming date
                  using image matching and AI.

                  Challenges included time management and including a functional map with clickable drop pins, and a web scraping feature
                  that could fill the app&apos;s index with local plant species.
